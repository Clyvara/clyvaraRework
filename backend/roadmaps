current setup: 
Supabase: User authentication & basic user data
FastAPI Backend: Chat functionality, basic API structure
PostgreSQL via pgAdmin4: Ready for dashboard data
React Frontend: Authentication flow, basic dashboard placeholder

Data Storage Strategy
Supabase (Keep):
User authentication (email, password, OAuth), User profile basics (name, email, avatar), Row Level Security (RLS) policies
PostgreSQL (Add):
Dashboard-specific data, Business logic data, Analytics and reporting, Complex relationships

Backend Dev Roadmap
Phase 1: Database Integration & Models 
- Add SQLAlchemy or asyncpg for PostgreSQL connection
- Create database connection pool
- Environment variables for database credentials

2. Data Models Design
Based on typical dashboard needs:

Users (extends Supabase user_id)
├── UserPreferences
├── DashboardLayouts
├── Widgets
├── DataSources
└── Analytics

Study/Content Data
├── Courses/Modules
├── Progress Tracking
├── Assessments
├── Resources
└── Certificates

3. API Endpoints Foundation
User profile management, Dashboard configuration CRUD, Data fetching endpoints

Phase 2: Authentication Integration 
1. Supabase JWT Validation
Middleware to validate Supabase tokens, Extract user_id from JWT, Connect Supabase users to PostgreSQL records

2. Protected Routes
Authentication middleware, Role-based access control, User context injection

Phase 3: Dashboard Data Layer 
1. Dashboard APIs
2. Real-time Data
WebSocket connections for live updates, Event-driven data refresh, Caching layer (Redis)

Phase 4: Advanced Features 
1. Analytics & Reporting
Data aggregation endpoints, Export functionality (CSV, PDF), Scheduled reports

2. Performance Optimization
Database indexing, Query optimization, API response caching, Pagination for large datasets

Technical Considerations
Database Design Patterns: 
Event Sourcing: Track all user actions for analytics
CQRS: Separate read/write models for performance
Data Partitioning: Separate tables by user or time periods

API Design
RESTful with GraphQL: REST for CRUD, GraphQL for complex queries
Versioning: /api/v1/ for future compatibility
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse
Input Validation: Pydantic models for all inputs

Security
JWT Validation: Verify all Supabase tokens
Data Encryption: Sensitive data at rest
Audit Logging: Track all data access
SQL Injection Prevention: Use parameterized queries

Monitoring & Observability
Essential Metrics: API response times, Database query performance, Error rates, User engagement metrics, Dashboard load times
